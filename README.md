# Omarchy Ash Ember Theme

Ash Ember is a fork of the [Ash](https://github.com/bjarneo/omarchy-ash-theme) theme for Omarchy, designed for users who want a warmer, deeper look on their Linux desktop while keeping the clean and elegant aesthetic of the original theme.

> Ember glow, a warm goodbye,  
> Where ashes whisper, sparks still fly.  
> Soft shadows dance on muted light,  
> A gentle end to the fiery night.
